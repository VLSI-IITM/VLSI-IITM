Hi, I’m Ashish Kr Sharma. I hold an M.Tech in VLSI from IIT Madras and a B.Tech from NIT Patna. With a strong foundation in hardware design and digital systems, I specialize in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as Verilog and SystemVerilog, with a focus on FPGA and VLSI projects.

On this GitHub, you'll find a wide range of projects that explore various aspects of digital design, including state machines, signal processing, communication protocols, and custom FPGA designs. I am passionate about solving HDL-related challenges and sharing knowledge through well-documented code, design examples, and thorough solutions.

If you're interested in learning, collaborating, or solving complex hardware design problems, feel free to explore my repositories, and let's connect!
